    While most of these mini programs are mere exercises, some are
    a bit more clever and provide some level of entertainment and utility.

   1 -> NBR_GAME : Three lines of obfuscated code for this mini game that
                   might amuse a first grader for up to twenty seconds.

   2 -> MM_GAME  : A version of the old board / deduction game 'Mastermind'
                   but with numbers rather than colors. Read about it in
                   an old C64 book.

   3 -> PWDGEN   : A simple password / token generator that takes
                   a formated string to spill out password suggestions.

   4 -> MEDT     : A small Hex-editor / Memory viewer / File dumper tool
                   Big enough to have its own help screen.

   5 -> PICROSS  : Picross / Nonogram based game. Unfinished yet.

   6 -> ANSIART  : Minimalist ANSI art (*.ans files) viewer. Very unfinished.

   7 -> EST_GAME : Estimation / Observation test game.

   8 -> FMERGE   : File stitching / Filter / Conversion tool
                   Some esoteric features in this one.

   9 -> PERM     : Permutation / Shuffle / Anagram tool

  10 -> SBFED    : File Encoding / Decoding tool

  11 -> PRIME    : Prime number evaluator.

  12 -> AJOKE    : "Gentlemen, The results speak for themselves."
